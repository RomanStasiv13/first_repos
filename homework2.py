###Task 1
###String manipulation
###Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given string.
###If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.
###Sample String: 'helloworld'
###Expected Result : 'held'
###Sample String: 'my'
###Expected Result : 'mymy'
###Sample String: ' x'
###Expected Result: Empty String
###Tips:
###Use built-in function len() on an input string
###Use positive indexing to get the first characters of a string and negative indexing to get the last characters


###Task 2
###The valid phone number program.
###Make a program that checks if a string is in the right format for a phone number.
###The program should check that the string contains only numerical characters and is only 10 characters long.
###Print a suitable message depending on the outcome of the string evaluation.

###Task 3
###The name check.
###The program should check if your input is equal to the stored name even
###if the given name has another case, e.g., if your input is “Anton” and the stored name is “anton”, it should return True.
